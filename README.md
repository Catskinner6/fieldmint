# Field Mint
A fresh configuration of LMDE 6 Cinnamon to be structured like a window manager.

Inspired by my desire to quickly configure a machine to my settings, and the re-skin of Ubuntu, known as "Omakub" by DHH.

"Field Mint" refers to how wild, field mint is rather plain. This is not a fully reskinned and themed version of Mint, but simply a set of desired packages, and settings for Cinnamon so that it behaves more like a window manager without losing Mint's already- incredibly polished user experience.

This was built for my preference of using LMDE 6, but will likely work on most recent Linux Mint versions. However, it has only been tested on LMDE 6.
